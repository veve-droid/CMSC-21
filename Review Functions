Exercise #1: Day of the Week
Maximum number of files: 1
Type of work: Individual work

Instructions
Clara Benin was born on February 19th 1994. Contrary to her song, that was a Saturday. It also was the 50th day of the year.

Given a year, a day, and a month, display 2 things:

- the day of the week that date falls on and
- what day of the year it is.


Note that not all years are the same, some years have a 29th of February (leap year) and most do not.

The Gregorian calendar has the following formula to calculate for whether a year is a leap year:
- the year is evenly divisible by 4;
- if the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
- the year is also evenly divisible by 400; then it is a leap year.

Knowing which year is a leap year, the calculation of what day of the year is trivial.

Calculating for the day of the week is trickier, but there exists some formulas to calculate for it. Here we describe Gauss' method:
Gauss' method calculates the week day of January 1 in Gregorian year number A with the following formula:
R(1+5R(A−1,4)+4R(A−1,100)+6R(A−1,400),7)
where R(y,m) is y mod m.

This gives us a number between 0 and 6, where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, and etc.
Given the day of the week of the first day of the year, getting the day of the week for any day of the year becomes trivial.
I want to see many functions: a function to calculate the day of the year, a function to see whether it is a leap year, a function to calculate Gauss' method, and etc!
