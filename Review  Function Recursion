Exercise #2: Recursion
Maximum number of files: 1
Type of work: Individual work

Instructions
All solutions should be implemented via recursion.

Given a choice input (1 - 3), accept arguments and perform an operation based on the following choice inputs:

Choice input 1: 2 positive integers follow---A and B; print out the quotient (whole integer part only) when A is divided by B; NO DIVISION, MULTIPLICATION, OR MODULO ALLOWED
Choice input 2: 2 integers follow---A and B; determine whether they are relatively prime or not; print 1 if relatively prime, 0 if not
Choice input 3: an integer (2 - 20) follows---A; accept and store A more sorted (ascending) integers; accept final search integer N; print 1 if N is one of the A integers, 0 if not.
